### Running Model on CSIF

1. Log into CSIF via the command line on any of the following computers: PC21 - PC25. These computers are the only ones with libraries that allow Tensorflow to work with the GPU.
2. Clone this repository by running: `git clone https://github.com/ECS171-Team-15/ECS171-Team-15`. Enter your Github username and password when prompted. If git asks you to create a [token](https://github.com/settings/tokens), you can generate one as your password that only works on CSIF. Also, if you don't want git to prompt you to enter your username and password every time, you may run `git config --global credential.helper store` to [save](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12240995) your password in a file located in your `home` directory.
3. Once the repository has been cloned, download the original and modified datasets by running:
```
cd ECS171-Team-15
bash fetch-data.sh
```
4. Preprocess the data by running:
```
cd processed-data
python3 preprocessing.py modified|original
```
This will generate a csv file with our preprocessed data.
But before training the model you will need to rename the CSV file to f'pix{height}x{width}.csv' (you should know what this means in python code).

4. Train the model. The trun.py source code contains the hyperparameters that will be used along with different seed values. You will need to supply the height and width of the images as parameters that you received from preprocessing.py. For convenience, original dataset has values 302 425 for height and width, respectively.
```
trun.py <height> <width>
```
Example for running the training and validation for the CNN model on the original dataset:
```
trun.py 302 425
```
will run 4 cases as the following:
```
      Running: C:\...\python.exe cnn_model.py  302 425 6 True l1_l2
      Running: C:\...\python.exe cnn_model.py  302 425 6 True None
      Running: C:\...\python.exe cnn_model.py  302 425 6 False l1_l2
      ...
```
Or you can run each case individually if you don't want to use the trun.py to run a combination of hyperpamaters for you automatically.

```
python3 cnn_model.py <height> <width> <random> <dropout> <regularizer>
```
The hyperparameters are as follows:
- random number (the seed used for our paper results): `6`
- dropout: `True`, `False`
- kernel regularizer: `l1_l2`, `None`

For example:
```
cnn_model.py 302 425 6 True l1_l2
```
will run only the first case within the above for trun.py:
```
Running: C:\...\python.exe cnn_model.py  302 425 6 True l1_l2
```

### Evaluating Model on CSIF

Note: this section is only verified on CSIF PC 21-25. If you run it on other PCs, you might get different results.

To evaluate the model:

1. Download any of the models from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lgG4LkhwK06ysk9o09jS8ABqopvbBQYz) to the `model/` folder.
2. Rename the CSV file (that was used to train the model and generate the .h5 files) to 'original.csv'.
3. Run `get-results.py` and it will generate the classification report for all the models in the `model/` folder.

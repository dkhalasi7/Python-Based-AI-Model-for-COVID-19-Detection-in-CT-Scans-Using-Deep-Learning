### Making Changes to Code

Changes to the repository are not made directly. Instead:

1. Create a fork of this repository. This is a copy of the repository that you may edit yourself!

2. Clone your fork to your local system.
3. Make and commit your changes to your fork.
4. Push your changes to your remote repository on Github.
5. To apply your changes, submit a pull request to this ![repository](https://github.com/ECS171-Team-15/ECS171-Team-15). Before doing this, make sure your fork is updated by fetching (retrieving the latest changes from this repository) and rebasing those changes to your fork. That way, your changes will be applied to the latest version of this repository.
6. Wait for the team leader to approve and merge your changes. (Merging means that your changes are finally applied to this repository)

**Modifying Your Pull Request**

If your changes aren't approved, you can create more commits (steps 3 and 4 above) and they will automatically show up in your commit. (*You don't have to close your pull request and create a new one.*)

**Commits**

By convention, your commit messages should be in the present tense. For example, the commit message:

`Implemented gradient descent`

should instead be:

`Implement gradient descent`
